FEATURES
- currently only does depth=1, should be able to do subdirectories as well.
    -> crawl subtree structure
    -> embed complete dir file tree as context
    -> add file path with file to information
    -> make it splittable 

TESTS
- tests that assure merging und unmerging worked (--> probably use hashing for that?)
